Merged Toolchain
================

The status quo as of late 2016 is that at mozilla we have a few independent
web-based tools, that are only loosely coupled.

This project is about creating a new home for these and to merge the best
pieces of each into that new home.

The tool will eventually host [l10n.m.o](https://l10n.mozilla.org/).

The idea is not to prevent other tools to help mozillians to localize
mozilla projects, but to have one suite that is integrated by default.

The tools to merge are
- [ ] a10n (automation for elmo)
- [ ] elmo (what's powering l10n.m.o in 2016)
- [ ] pontoon (mozilla online l10n editing tool)
- [ ] webdashboard (supports web projects and other one-offs in 2016)

See the [project roadmap](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/roadmap/projects/3) for
details.
